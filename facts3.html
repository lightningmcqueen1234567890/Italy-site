            Italy has Europes only active volcanos! Mt. Etna, Mt. Stromboli, and Vesuvius! While 
            <br> Etna and Stromboli erupt on a regular basis, Vesuvius' last eruption was way back in 1944!

            (Above) Locals watch as Vesuvius erupts in 1944, right in the middle of an American raid aimed 
            <br> at kicking the axis out of Italy. Many of the B-22 Bombers got ariel pictures of the eruption!

            (Above) Just another day for the locals! Despite Mt. Etna erupting on a regular basis, cities and 
            <br> towns cram themselves at its base, as the volcanic soil is some of the most fertile on earth. That's 
            <br> why the Italian island of Sicily is so famous for its agriculture!

            (Above) Stromboli is a tiny island off the coast of Italy, yet it is easily the most ferocious of the three!
            <br> There is however a small town on the tiny island! Those townsfolk must have a hard time walking with those balls of steel.
